A Scooby-Doo dataset obtained from tidyTuesday was analyzed to look at which character catches, captures, unmasks, and snacks the most throughout all of the Scooby-Doo series. A shiny app was made to aid in the understanding of how these outcomes change based on certain characteristics of the investigations. It was found that throughout all of the Scooby-Doo series, Daphnie captures and snacks the most, Shaggy says his catchphrase, Zoinks, the most, Scooby catches the most, and Fred unmasks the most.
